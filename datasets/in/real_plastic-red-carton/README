The unit of the numbers in 
	camera_pos.txt
	light_pos.txt
	image_size.txt (physical size of those photos, eg. 12.672 x 12.672)
is cm

The 3 numbers in 
	light_power.txt
are the intensity of camera flash light. For most of the phones, you can keep using it.
Numbers here are roughly estimated, it has not to be super accurate because it would be compensated by albedo. If you want, you can optimize those as well.
